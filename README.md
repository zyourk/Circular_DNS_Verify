# Circular_DNS_Verify
 
## Purpose
 This program is written in Python with the purpose of digging through a subnet, seeing what hostname each IP resolves to, and doing the reverse to find out if the hostname resolves back to the same IP it should.

## Update Roadmap
 Many updates are planned for the program such as: incorporating pinging devices and only carrying on with DNS verification if the box is active, as well as fixing a bug involving the socket library.

## Use
 The program is user friendly, so all the user has to do is specify the subnet to dig through.
