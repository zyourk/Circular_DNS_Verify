# Circular_DNS_Verify
 
## Purpose
 This program is written in Python with the purpose of digging through a subnet, seeing what hostname each IP resolves to, and doing the reverse to find out if the hostname resolves back to the same IP it should.

## Update Roadmap
 Many updates are planned for the program such as: ~~incorporating pinging devices and only carrying on with DNS verification if the IP is pingable~~ (completed), as well as fixing a bug involving the socket  
 library.
 </br>New Update Plan: ~~Adding a prompt to switch between requiring pings or not.~~ (completed)
 </br>Include a feature that allows pointing to different DNS servers

## Use
 The program is user friendly, so all the user has to do is specify the subnet to dig through.
